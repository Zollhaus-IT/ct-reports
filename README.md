# CT Report

This project is a Quarkus application that retrieves data from the Churchtools API and stores it in a database.

The project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/ .

## Running the application in dev mode

First of all, you need to create a Churchtools API Keys online (https://<your-domain>.church.tools/api/persons/<your-person-id>/logintoken). 
Remember that you need to be logged in, to retrieve your token. Once your tokes is created add it to the application.properties file.
```yaml
ct.logintoken=<your-token>
```

Afterwards, you can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
# start the dev postgres database
docker-compose -f ./.local/docker-compose.yml up -d

# create the database schema via docker exec and postgres psql
docker exec -it postgres psql -U postgres-user -c "CREATE DATABASE ctreportdb"

# start the quarkus application in dev mode
./mvnw clean compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8088/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/code-with-quarkus-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling.
